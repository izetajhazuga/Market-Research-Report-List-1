<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Keyless Bushing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Frictional Locking"</li><li>"Mechanical Locking"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Keyless Bushing market is divided into two main types: Frictional Locking and Mechanical Locking. Frictional Locking relies on the friction between the bushing and the shaft to transmit torque, providing a flexible solution that can easily accommodate misalignments. Mechanical Locking, on the other hand, uses a mechanical mechanism, such as screws or clamps, for a stronger, more secure connection, making it ideal for high-torque applications. Both types offer advantages in precision, ease of installation, and maintenance.</p></p>
