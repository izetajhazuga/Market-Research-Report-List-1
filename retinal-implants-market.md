<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retinal Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epiretinal Implants</li><li>Subretinal Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retinal implants market is primarily categorized into two types: epiretinal implants and subretinal implants. Epiretinal implants are placed on the surface of the retina, stimulating retinal cells directly and often suited for patients with diseases like retinitis pigmentosa. In contrast, subretinal implants are inserted beneath the retina, targeting photoreceptors and preserving the retinal structure. Both types aim to restore vision in individuals with severe vision loss, enhancing their quality of life through innovative neuroprosthetic technology.</p></p>
